The term is a portmanteau of Metroid and Castlevania and refers to games that feature the most distinctive gameplay concepts of the Metroid games and later Castlevania games, starting with Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (although Castlevania II: Simon's Quest is sometimes considered to be in the same category). Games of this genre feature gameplay in an explorable world that is gated in content mainly by specific abilities that need to be acquired by the player, and which gradually opens up more as the player overcomes its obstacles. Generally these games have a central hub from which the player can move to various interconnected areas or levels, some degree of persistency to their game worlds and some degree of non-linear progression while subtly guiding the player towards the next intended path.\\n\\nThe vast majority of Metroidvania games use a side scrolling perspective like the games the term derives from and the term was for a long time used to describe only such games, but this is no longer a requirement. Top-down or bird's-eye view (e.g. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening) or 3D games (e.g. Batman: Arkham Asylum) can also share these concepts.\\n\\nMetroidvania games often feature mild RPG elements such as stat-based character development (upgradable health, strength and luck for example), respawning enemies, NPCs that talk to the player and trading for gear and items. \",\n",

In terms of use and practice, 4X is some what more complex and may have expanded from its original definition.\\n\\nTraditionally 4X was first popularly used to identify strategy games such as Sid Meier\\'s Civilization and Master of Orion, although 4X games by its characteristics may have existed far earlier than the aforementioned games.\\n\\nA 4X game <b>must</b> fulfill <b>ALL</b> the following requirements:\\n<ul><li><b>Strategic Gameplay</b></li>\\nThe player usually plays the role of a leader or adviser to a race, faction, country, civilization, nation, or any bunch of blokes in a large scale population against opposing forces. The game genre is usually limited to the strategy gameplay. No other genres have been identified under 4X.\\n\\n<li><b>eXploration</b></li>\\nThe eXploration category identifies the purpose of exploring surrounding territories, which may signify the use of a <b>map</b>. Exploration is conducted by sending out units to unexplored regions, where newly discovered locations become and remain revealed, depending on the variations of an implemented fog of war effect.\\n\\n<li><b>eXpansion</b></li>\\nThe eXpansion category identifies the objective to expand territory or area of control, usually (optional) after eXploration campaigns have been successfully carried out. The strategy of eXpansion requires a balance between the player\\'s ability to expand as well as the player\\'s ability to defend and hold conquered or areas under the player\\'s control. Existing or new areas/territories (towns, planets, etc.), may then be developed with structural buildings or other enhancements.\\n\\n<li><b>eXploitation</b></li>\\nThe eXploitation category identifies the objective to control resources, where resources may or may not be limited. The eXploitation category goes hand-in-hand with the eXpansion category: the more territory the player controls, the less the opponent does, thus the more resources the player has to his/her disposal.\\n\\n<li><b>eXtermination</b></li>\\nThe eXtermination category is the result of continuous expansion. Conflict is inevitable and when push comes to shove, extermination of the opponent is eminent. Extermination requires the total elimination of an opponent or to subdue the opponent under the player\\'s direct or indirect control (i.e. vassal, puppet, etc.) via armed conflict or diplomatic devices.\\n\\n<li><b>Randomly Generated Environments</b></li>\\nSee the <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/games-with-randomly-generated-environments\">Games with randomly generated environments</a> game group for further information.\\n\\n<li><b>Structural Building</b></li>\\nNo 4X game has been identified to do without a structural building or similar devices. Anything from a latrine to a planetary doomsday weapon station may be used to further advance the player\\'s purpose.\\n\\n<li><b>Technological Advancement</b></li>\\nTraditionally, 4X games have identified the use of technology advancements (or popularly known as a technology tree). These advancements are usually identified with the requirement to use resources, time to research, upgrade an idea or object, or other steps/factors needed before a certain (new or upgraded) technological benefit, unit, building, or similar devices be available to the player.\\n\\n<li><b>Diplomacy</b></li>\\nThe concept of <i>not being alone in this existence</i> refers to other beings(s) that may have different goals or priorities than the player. Diplomacy is the bridge to those differences of 4X. Diplomacy is used to make allies or enemies, trade resources and information, or even as a channel for espionage. Most 4X games prefer complex uses of diplomacy rather than the standard <i>friend or foe</i> commonly found in non-4X strategy war games.\\n</ul>\\n<b>Limitations</b><br>\\nFor purposes of this game group, games where primary gameplay focuses only on <b>eXtermination</b> without any other possible victory conditions are <b>excluded</b> from this game group.\\n\\nThis means games such as Age of Empires, Command & Conquer, Heroes of Might and Magic, or Warcraft <b>should not</b> go here.\\n\\n<b>Additional Note</b><br>\\nSome hybrid games do not follow the traditional identification of 4X games, disabling one or more of its common features, yet may officially identify itself under the same genre. Whether or not these games should be included remain open for debate.',\n",
