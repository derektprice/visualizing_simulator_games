Distribution of releases over time (histogram of release years)

Publishers working with the highest number of developers

Developers with the most games

publishers with the most games

Things my analysis shows:

- DOS is the primary platform for this genre up until XXXX, at which point Windows (PC) becomes the primary platform

- Racing games are a big part of this genre

- When we separate racing games, we see a very different constellation of developers and publishers

Presentation Script:

Title slide: I want to introduce you to a dashboard that I created, which is intended to help you understand some aspects of the history and production context of a specific genre of computer games that I call "simulator games."

Slide 2: Simulator games are nonfiction simulations of industrial work and machines which attempt to portray their subject matter realistically. As a genre, simulator games have a long, transnational history, beginning as training and testing tools in military and automotive contexts and eventually becoming popular, commercial video games. 

Slide 3: Some of the more well-known examples of games from this genre include the "Microsoft Flight Simulator" series, and a more recent and popular series is the "Farming Simulator" series.

Slide 4: It is often the case that marketing campaigns, popular discourse, journalism, and sometimes even research into computer games fail to communicate the production context and history of a genre â€“ this dashboard aims to reunite the genre of simulator games with some aspects of its historical production context.

Slide 5: To build this dashboard, I collected data from the online games database MobyGames.com through their API using Python, and the dashboard itself is built in PowerBI. The data I'm working with is 1250 games in MobyGames' "vehicle simulation" genre category. This genre category is the closest approximation to the simulator game genre, and Mobygames describes the genre in the following way:

"Vehicle Simulator games are games in which the player takes control of any type of vehicle in a peaceful manner. A game is required to have a certain level of realism to be considered a simulator. Vehicles may be fictional such as space ships. This genre is not to be used for games that allow the player to perform combat in said vehicles; use Vehicular Combat Simulator instead."

Every game can have multiple genre categories, but every game in this dataset of 1250 has, at least, the genre category of "vehicle simulator". I also collected to following kinds of data on each game:

- Developer Name
- Publisher Name
- Title of each game
- Description of each game
- Platform (for first release)
- Year of first release
- Url on MobyGames
- All Genre tags for each game

With that context, I'll walk you through the dashboard and some of the insights I've gained by analyzing this data.

Histogram of release years - this chart shows how many games in this genre were released in total, from 1969 - 2021 (bins of 4 years)

This page allows users focus on specific timeframes to see which developers produced which games, and is ranked by total number of games developed.

First takeaway: One key takeway from this dashboard about dervelopers (which allows for a more nuanced view than a similar dashboard with publishers) is that many of the developers with the most games in this genre are making various kinds of "racing" games. (Codemasters, Davilex Games, Milestone s.r.l)

When we separate racing games from other vehicle simulators, we find a very different list of "top" developers, as can be seen in the following two pages.
