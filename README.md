# visualizing_simulator_games
A project dedicated to visualizing the production context of "simulator" computer games.

This project uses data collected from [MobyGames.com](https://www.mobygames.com/){:target="_blank"} to visualize the production context and history of the "simulator game" genre of computer games. 

Simulator games are nonfiction simulations of industrial work and machines which attempt to portray their subject matter realistically. As a genre, simulator games have a long, transnational history, beginning as training and testing tools in military and automotive contexts and eventually becoming popular, commercial video games.

Data for this project was collected through MobyGames's API using Python, and was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using Python, Excel, and PowerBI.

For additional context, see the pdf of slides in this repo.
